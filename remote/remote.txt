Remote JSON protocol for Evolution

Start:

    The players connect to the main server.
    the main server acknowledges the players
    if they can join. Otherwise, sends
    "game full" message if the game is full.

Turn: Step 1

    The dealer sends each player their state, at the
    beginning of the turn after being updated to
    include new cards and species board (optional)

    +------------+
    |   server   |
    +-----+------+          +-----------+

          |                       |                      |


Turn: Steps 2 and 3

  - The dealer sends other player states to the current
    player and asks him to choose what cards to play.
  - The player responds with an Action4 of their choices.

    +-------------+

    +-----+-------+     +-----------+  +------------+
          |             |  Player1  |  |  Player2   |

          |     Action4      |                |
          | <=================================|
          |                  |                |

    choose = ["choose", [[LOS, ...], [LOS, ....]]


Turn: Step 4

    The dealer asks the player to make a
    feeding choice if there is more than
    one choice.

    +-----------+       +----------+     +----------+
    |  Server   |       |  Player1 |     | Player2  |
    +-----------+       +-----+----+     +-----+----+
          |                   |                |
          |  feed-next        |                |
          +-----------------> |                |
          |   food-choice     |                |
          | <=================+                |
          |      feed-next    |                |
          +----------------------------------> |
          |      food-choice  |                |
          | <================================= |
          |                   |                |
          |                   |                |
         ...                 ...              ...
          |                   |                |
          |                   |                |
          +                   +                +

    A feed-next is: ["feed", Nat, [LOS, ...], Player+]
      the Nat is the wateringhole
      each LOS is an opposing player's list of species,
        starting with the next player\
      the Player+ is the current player's full state

    A feed-choice is one of:
     - false

    - Natural
        the index of a single species of the currently
        feeding player that is vegetarian and gets the
        next token of food;

    - [Natural, Nat+]
        combines an index to a given species and
        desired number of food tokensâ€”meaning the
        indexed species of the currently feeding player
        comes with a fat-tissue trait and wishes to
        store the specified number of food tokens on
        that trait;

    - [Natural, Natural, Natural]\
        the first Natural pointing to a carnivore of the
          current player,
        the second Natural points to the target player,
        the third Natural points to the target species
          on the target player


End game:

    At the end of the game, the dealer sends the players all of
    the scores, sorted by descending score.

    +------------+  +-----------+  +-------------+
    |   server   |  | player1   |  |   player2   |

          +-----------------------------> |
          |               |               |

    score = [[Nat+, Nat], ...]
      where each Nat+ is a player id and the Nat is the corresponding score
